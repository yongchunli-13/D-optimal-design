This project contains the implementations of greedy and local search algorithms for solving D-optimal design, which correspond to files greedy.py, local_search.py respectively. Further, in the user.py file, we randomly generate the dataset, carry out data preprocessing and define objective functions. The datagen.py file is used to set the number of experiments (n), dimension (d), and the number of selected experiments (k). Please directly go to the datagen.py file, set up the size of the D-optimal design problem, and then obtain the numerical results.
